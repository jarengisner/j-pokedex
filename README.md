# j-pokedex

Technologies used:
-HTML
-Javascript
-CSS

API used: 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=1000'.

By connecting an external API, the goal is to build a Pokedex app,
using javascript to display our pokemon (objects) onto the page.

The app will function by displaying all pokemon to the page, as well as contain
a functioning search bar, and modals for each pokemon.
